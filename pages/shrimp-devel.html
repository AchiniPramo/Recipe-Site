          Prawns Devel is a vibrant and spicy Sri Lankan dish featuring
          succulent shrimp that is marinated and stir-fried with onions, bell
          peppers, and a medley of bold spices. The shrimp is cooked to
          perfection, allowing the flavors to meld and create a dish that's both
          fiery and tangy. A touch of vinegar or lemon juice adds a zesty twist,
          enhancing the overall taste. Shrimp Devel is known for its intense
          flavors and is often served with rice or enjoyed as a tantalizing
          appetizer. It's a favorite in Sri Lankan cuisine for those who
          appreciate a spicy seafood dish with a punch.

          <ol>
            <li>
              Marinate shrimp with salt, black pepper, and lime juice. Set it
              aside for 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mix water and cornstarch together in a small bowl. Add ketchup,
              soy sauce, and sugar to it and mix well to combine. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heat a wok or large sauté pan to high heat. Add oil and let it
              heat up. Add shrimp to the pan and fry on high heat until shrimp
              are completely cooked (no raw parts visible).
            </li>
            <li>
              Turn off the heat. Using a slotted spoon, drain and remove shrimp
              from the pan to a separate clean plate. (If there's any juice left
              in the pan, turn the heat back on and let the liquid evaporate.)
            </li>
            <li>
              Turn the heat to medium. Add another 1 tbsp of oil (you can skip
              adding extra oil if your pan already has enough oil left from
              frying shrimp). Add ginger and garlic. Sauté until garlic turns
              light brown on the edges.
            </li>
            <li>
              Then add chili flakes and Sri Lankan-Chinese chili paste. Sauté
              for a few seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add shrimp, onions, and peppers to the pan and mix until all the
              shrimp are coated with chili flakes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lower the heat. Add the sauce. Mix well to coat everything with
              the sauce.
            </li>
            <li>Finally, add tomatoes. Gently mix with shrimp.</li>
