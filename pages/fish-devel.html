          <h2>How to Make the Fish Devel Step by Step</h2>

          <h3>Marinate and Fry Fish</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Cut tuna into large chunks (about 2 inches long cuboids).</li>
            <li>
              Make the marinade with paprika or chili powder, black pepper, lime
              juice, salt, and water. Add the fish pieces and mix to coat every
              piece with the marinade. Be careful to do it gently as the fish
              pieces can break apart. Set it aside and let it marinate until you
              make the sauce and get the other ingredients ready (about 10 - 15
              mins).
            </li>
            <br />
            <img src="/assets/images/fish.jpg" alt="Marinated Fish" />
            <br />
            <li>
              Heat enough oil to deep fry in a deep skillet. Wait until the oil
              is hot. Gently add fish pieces to the oil and fry them until the
              edges start to turn golden and the fish is cooked through.
              Transfer fish to a paper towel-lined plate.
            </li>
            <br />

          </ol>

          <h3>Make the Sauce</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Add cornstarch and water to a small bowl. Mix. Then add all the
              remaining sauce ingredients: ketchup, chili sauce, soy sauce,
              sugar, and salt. Mix and set aside.
            </li>
            <br />

          </ol>

          <h3>Making the Devilled Fish</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Crush ginger and garlic in a mortar and pestle or chop them very
              finely.
            </li>
            <br />

            />
            <br />
            <li>
              Cut banana peppers into rounds. Cut onion into large triangular
              pieces or rounds, and tomato into wedges.
            </li>

            />
            <br />
            <li>
              Heat a medium-sized wok or a saute pan. Add oil and let it heat
              up. Add cinnamon stick, ginger, garlic, curry leaves, and pandan
              leaves. Saute until the garlic starts to turn golden on the edges.
            </li>

            <br />
            <li>
              Add chili flakes, chili paste, and black pepper. Saute for about
              10 seconds or until chili flakes turn dark red.

            <br />
            <li>
              Add banana peppers and onions. Saute for another 10-15 seconds to
              mix through.
            </li>

            <br />
            <li>
              Move everything to the side and add the sauce. Let the sauce heat
              up. When the sauce is heated, mix it with the vegetables.
            </li>

            <br />
            <li>
              Add fried fish pieces. Gently mix everything well to coat all the
              fish pieces with the sauce (be careful not to break the fish
              pieces). Adjust salt if needed.
            </li>

            <br />
            <li>
              Add tomatoes. Mix very lightly. You can serve the dish at this
              point or proceed to the next step if you prefer more gravy.

            <br />
            <li>
              Add 1/2 cup of water and mix. Let the gravy heat up, and when it
              starts to thicken, turn off the heat. It will thicken further as
              it cools down. Avoid simmering too long to prevent overcooking the
              fish and vegetables.
