        <h2>How to Make Taco Pizza Step by Step</h2>

        <article>
          <h3><b>Pizza Dough</b></h3>
          <p>
            1. Pour the water into a measuring cup, add the yeast, and leave it
            until it's bloomed and formed a creamy frothy head, about 10
            minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. Add the flour, salt, and olive oil to a bowl and pour in the
            yeast.
          </p>
          <p>3. Mix until it comes together into a dough, about 5 minutes.</p>
          <p>
            4. Dust a large surface with flour and turn the dough onto it.
            <br /><br />
            5. Knead the dough by pressing the heels of your hands into the
            surface, pushing it away, then folding it and pulling it back.
            Rotate each time you knead. Continue until the dough is smooth,
            about 5 minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            6. Cut the dough into 4 pieces using a bench scraper, wrap each
            piece in a separate ziploc bag, and place it in the fridge.

          <p>
            7. Leave the dough in the fridge for 36 hours.
            <br /><br />
            8. Remove the dough from the fridge 2 hours before you plan to use
            it.
            <br /><br />
            9. Roll it into a tight ball and place it on a floured surface.
            Flour the top of the balls, cover with cellophane, then a tea towel,
            and put in a warm place.

          <h3><b>Assembling the Taco Pizza:</b></h3>
          <p>1. Preheat your oven to 500°F (260°C).</p>
          <p>
            2. Roll out the pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired
            thickness and place it on a pizza stone or baking sheet.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Spread the refried beans over the pizza dough, followed by half
            of the salsa.
          </p>
          <p>
            4. Sprinkle the seasoned ground beef evenly over the beans and
            salsa.
          </p>
          <p>5. Top with shredded cheddar cheese.</p>
          <p>
            6. Bake in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes, or until the
            crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly.
          </p>
          <p>
            7. Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool slightly. Top with
            chopped lettuce, tomatoes, olives, green onions, and crushed
            tortilla chips.
          </p>
          <p>8. Drizzle with the remaining salsa and sour cream.</p>
