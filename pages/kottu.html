        <h2>What is Kottu Roti?</h2>
        <p>
          This dish has become the national food of Sri Lanka (hypothetically).
          It can be found in every corner of Sri Lanka and every food shop makes
          kottu. Originally a street food, now even five-star hotels feature it
          on their menus due to its popularity.

        <h2>About Sri Lankan Kottu Roti</h2>
        <p>
          If you ever visit Sri Lanka, no trip is complete without eating this
          amazing spicy dish. It’s designed to be eaten standing up, as it was
          meant to be a one-pot meal. The distinctive sound of street vendors
          making kottu is hard to miss. The real name is Kottu Roti, but it’s
          commonly referred to as ‘kottu’ or ‘koththu’.

        <h2>Can I Make Kottu Roti at Home?</h2>
        <p>
          Yes, it’s quite simple. Many high-end restaurants prepare kottu roti
          by having the roti shredded and the condiments ready. They then cook
          it in a wok or pan, which is the method used in my recipe.

        <h2>Can I Substitute the Roti?</h2>
        <p>
          You can use store-bought paratha or roti, but making it from scratch
          is easy and provides better flavor. Click here to get my roti recipe.

        <p>
          While Sri Lankan households often buy roti instead of making it, being
          abroad might require you to make it at home to satisfy cravings.
