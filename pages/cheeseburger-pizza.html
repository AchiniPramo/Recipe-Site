            Cheeseburger Pizza is the perfect fusion of two classic favorites:

            cheese, pickles, onions, and a drizzle of ketchup and mustard, this
            pizza is sure to satisfy your cravings.

        <h2>How to Make Cheeseburger Pizza Step by Step</h2>

        <article>
          <h3><b>1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (204°C):</b></h3>
          <p>
            Sprinkle a 12-14-inch pizza pan with the cornmeal. This will keep
            your pizza crust from sticking to the pan later. Set the pan aside.
          </p>

          />
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3><b>2. Prepare the secret sauce:</b></h3>
          <p>
            In a medium bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, yellow onion,
            ketchup, yellow mustard, lemon juice, sweet paprika, and salt until
            smooth. Once the mixture is smooth, allow it to sit at room
            temperature or in the fridge to allow the flavors to combine while
            you start cooking the ground meat. You’ll have between 1 1/4 and 1
            1/2 cups of sauce.
          </p>

            alt="Preparing the Sauce"
          />
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3><b>3. Brown the ground beef and onions:</b></h3>
          <p>
            Add the ground meat and onions to a large skillet. Turn the stove up
            to medium-high heat and sprinkle the burger seasoning over the beef
            and onions. Cooking the meat this way eliminates the need for
            additional oil in the pan, as the fat will render from the meat.
            <br /><br />

            Once the stove has been turned on, start breaking up the meat and
            mixing in the onions and spices with a spoon or spatula.
            <br /><br />

            Cook until the meat is fully cooked and no pink remains, about 10
            minutes. Use a large spoon to drain off most of the fat; discard the
            fat. Set the skillet aside, off the heat.
          </p>

          <h3><b>4. Par-bake the pizza crust:</b></h3>
          <p>
            Prepare the egg wash in a small bowl by whisking together the egg
            yolk and cold water. <br /><br />

            Brush a 1 1/2-inch border around the outer rim of the pizza dough
            with the egg wash. Roll the edges of the pizza in 2 inches towards
            the center of the circle to create the pizza crust. Brush a light
            layer of the egg wash onto the crust you've just formed and sprinkle
            the sesame seeds onto the egg wash. Use the tines of a fork to prick
            holes in the dough in the center of the pan.
            <br /><br />

            Slide the pan into the preheated oven and bake for 10 minutes.

        </article>

        <article>
          <h3><b>5. Assemble and finish baking:</b></h3>
          <p>
            Once the pizza dough is lightly browned and has blistered slightly,
            remove the pan from the oven. <br /><br />

            Use the back of a wide spoon to spread 1 1/4 cups of the secret
            sauce onto the pizza crust. Sprinkle half of the shredded cheddar
            cheese over the sauce, then top the cheese with the seasoned
            burger-onion mixture. Next, arrange the pickles and halved tomatoes
            on top of the beef and top with the remaining cheese.
            <br /><br />

            Bake the pizza until the cheese is fully melted and the pizza crust
            is golden brown in color, 10-12 minutes.

        <article>
          <h3><b>6. Garnish and serve:</b></h3>
          <p>
            Once the pizza is fully baked, remove it from the oven and allow it
            to cool for 1-2 minutes before sprinkling it with the shredded
            lettuce and drizzling the remaining 1/4 cup of secret sauce over it.
            <br /><br />

            Cut and serve while hot. This pizza is best when eaten on the same
            day it's prepared.
