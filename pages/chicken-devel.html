          Chicken Devel is a spicy and tangy Sri Lankan dish made by stir-frying
          marinated chicken with onions, bell peppers, tomatoes, and a blend of
          fiery spices. The chicken is often cooked until crispy, and the dish
          is finished with a splash of vinegar or lemon juice, giving it a
          distinctive, zesty flavor. Chicken Devel is known for its bold taste
          and is typically enjoyed with rice or as a flavorful appetizer. It's a
          popular choice in Sri Lankan cuisine for those who love intense,
          savory dishes with a kick.

              Cut the chicken to the required size and place it in a bowl.
              <br /><br />
              Place chicken in a bowl, add turmeric (1 tsp), chili powder (1
              tsp), salt (1/2 teaspoon), and combine. Set aside for 15 minutes.

              Place a shallow skillet or pan over medium heat, and pour 1/4 cup
              oil into the pan. <br /><br />
              Let the oil heat slightly and shallow fry the chicken until they
              turn golden brown on the edges.

            <li>
              Make sure not to burn yourself while frying the chicken. Toss the
              chicken constantly so they fry evenly. This should take 10-15
              minutes.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Place the same pan with the remaining oil over medium heat.
              <br /><br />
              Add the minced garlic and ginger (1 tbsp each) to the oil and
              saut√© for two minutes. <br /><br />
              Add the onions (2 medium), capsicum (4), and tomatoes (2) to the
              pan.
