            Spicy Sausage Pizza is a fiery and flavorful dish perfect for those
            who love a bit of heat. This pizza combines the richness of
            mozzarella cheese, the zest of spicy sausage, and the tanginess of
            tomato sauce, all on a crispy pizza crust. The spiciness of the
            sausage is balanced by the savory flavors of the cheese and the
            freshness of the vegetables, making it a crowd-pleaser.
            <br /><br />
            This Spicy Sausage Pizza is savory, salty, and delicious. The crust
            is chewy and soft, while the marinara is bright and fresh and the
            mozzarella and sausage mixture are deeply flavorful. I promise you
            that once you try making this pizza it will become your new go-to
            recipe.

          <h3><b>Pizza Dough</b></h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              1. Pour the water into a measuring cup, add the yeast, and leave
              it until it's bloomed and formed a creamy frothy head, about 10
              minutes.

          </div>

          <div>
            <p>
              2. Add the flour, salt, and olive oil to a bowl and pour in the
              yeast.
            </p>

          <div>
            <p>
              3. Mix until it comes together into a dough, about 5 minutes. It
              will not be smooth.
            </p>
            <img src="/assets/images/pizza dough2.jpg" alt="Mixing Dough" />
          </div>

          <div>
            <p>
              4. Dust a large surface with flour and turn the dough onto it.
              <br /><br />
              5. Knead the dough by pressing the heels of your hands into the
              surface, pushing it away, then folding it and pulling it back.
              Rotate each time you knead. Continue until the dough is smooth, 5
              minutes.

            <p>
              6. Cut the dough into 4 pieces using the bench scraper, wrap each
              piece in a separate Ziploc bag, and place it in the fridge.

          <div>
            <p>
              7. Leave the dough in the fridge for 36 hours.
              <br /><br />
              8. Remove the dough from the fridge 2 hours before you plan to use
              it.
              <br /><br />
              9. Roll it into a tight ball and place it on a floured surface.
              Flour the top of the balls, cover with cellophane and then a tea
              towel, and put in a warm place.
